# This configuration serves as a default template that can be used in every project. It includes the following details:


## ESLint Configuration Details

- `extends`: This property specifies the set of ESLint configurations that are extended in this project. The configurations being extended are `next/core-web-vitals`, `plugin:@next/next/recommended`, `prettier`, and `plugin:prettier/recommended`.

- `parser`: The parser used for parsing the code is `@typescript-eslint/parser`.

- `parserOptions`: This property specifies the parser options used in the project. The `ecmaFeatures` object enables JSX parsing, and the `ecmaVersion` property specifies the ECMAScript version used. The `sourceType` property is set to `module` to indicate the use of ECMAScript modules.

- `plugins`: This property lists the ESLint plugins used in the project. The plugins being used are `import`, `@typescript-eslint`, and `prettier`.

- `rules`: This property specifies the ESLint rules used in the project. The `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` rule is set to `"warn"`, which warns about unused variables. The `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` rule is set to `"error"`, which throws an error when `any` type is used. The `import/order` rule is set to `"warn"` and includes additional configuration options for ordering imports.

- `settings`: This property specifies the ESLint settings used in the project. The `import/resolver` property configures the TypeScript resolver to use the `tsconfig.json` file for resolving imports. The `react` property is set to `"detect"`, which automatically detects the React version used in the project.

## Husky Library

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) is a library that allows you to easily add Git hooks to your project. Git hooks are scripts that run automatically before or after certain Git events, such as committing code.

In this project, Husky is used to set up a pre-commit hook. The pre-commit hook is triggered before a commit is made and runs the `lint-staged` command.

## lint-staged

[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) is a tool that allows you to run linters on staged files. Staged files are the files that are about to be committed.

In this project, lint-staged is configured to run ESLint and Prettier on TypeScript files (`*.ts`) and TypeScript React files (`*.tsx`) before each commit. The `eslint --fix` command automatically fixes any linting errors, and the `prettier --write` command formats the code according to the Prettier configuration.

By using lint-staged, you can ensure that only properly formatted and linted code is committed to your repository.

Please refer to the official ESLint and lint-staged documentation for more information on each configuration option.


## Metadata Configuration

To configure the metadata for your site, make the following changes:

- Set the `metadataBase` property in the `metadata` object to the URL of your site.

- Set the `title` and `description` property in the `shared-metadata.ts` 

- Update the `url` property in the `openGraph` object to the root URL of your site.

Please make these changes according to your project requirements.
